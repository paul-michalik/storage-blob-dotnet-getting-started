    <!-- This sample is configured for running against the storage emulator on Windows.
         If you have an Azure subscription and prefer to run the samples against Azure Storage, or if you are running on Linux or OS X,
         you can create a storage account and run against Azure Storage. Comment out the connection string below and use the 
         second connection string. Insert your storage account name and key in the placeholders in the line below.          
         We recommend creating a new storage account for testing purposes, rather than using a production account for running the samples.-->
